# My First Hackathon Project - PLP Africa

Welcome to my inaugural hackathon project developed during the PLP Africa hackathon! This project represents my first venture into collaborative coding and rapid prototyping within a competitive environment.

## Project Overview

This web application showcases my skills in frontend development and my ability to create functional solutions under time constraints. The project demonstrates my understanding of core web technologies and responsive design principles.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (if applicable)
- Responsive Design Principles

## Key Features

- Modern, responsive user interface
- Clean and intuitive design
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile-first approach
